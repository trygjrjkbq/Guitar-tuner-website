                Look at the stars
                Look how they shine for you
                And everything you do
                Yeah, they were all yellow

                I came along
                I wrote a song for you
                And all the things you do
                And it was called "Yellow"

                So then I took my turn
                Oh, what a thing to have done
                And it was all yellow

                Your skin, oh yeah, your skin, and bones
                Turn into something beautiful
                And you know, you know I love you so
                You know I love you so

                I swam across
                I jumped across for you
                Oh, what a thing to do
                'Cause you were all yellow

                I drew a line
                I drew a line for you
                Oh, what a thing to do
                And it was all yellow

                And your skin, oh yeah, your skin, and bones
                Turn into something beautiful
                And you know, for you, I'd bleed myself dry
                For you, I'd bleed myself dry

                It's true
                Look how they shine for you
                Look how they shine for you
                Look how they shine for
