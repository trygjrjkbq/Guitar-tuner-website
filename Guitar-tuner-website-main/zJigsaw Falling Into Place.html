                Just as you take my hand
                Just as you write my number down
                Just as the drinks arrive
                Just as they play your favourite song
                As your bad day disappears
                No longer wound up like a spring
                Before you've had too much
                Come back in focus again

                The walls are bending shape
                They got a Cheshire cat grin
                All blurring into one
                This place is on a mission
                Before the night owl
                Before the animal noises
                Closed circuit cameras
                Before you comatose

                Before you run away from me
                Before you're lost between the notes
                The beat goes 'round and 'round
                The beat goes 'round and 'round
                I never really got there
                I just pretended that I had
                Words are blunt instruments
                Words are sawn off shotguns

                Come on and let it out
                Come on and let it out
                Come on and let it out
                Come on and let it out

                Before you run away from me
                Before you're lost between the notes
                Just as you take the mic
                Just as you dance, dance, dance

                A jigsaw falling into place
                So there is nothing to explain
                You eye each other as you pass
                She looks back and you look back
                Not just once, not just twice

                Wish away your nightmare, wish away the nightmare
                You got a light, you can feel it on your back
                A light and you can feel it on your back
                Your jigsaw falling into place
