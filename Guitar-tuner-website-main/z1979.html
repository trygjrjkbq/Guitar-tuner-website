                Shake down 1979
                Cool kids never have the time
                On a live wire right up off the street
                You and I should meet

                Junebug skippin' like a stone
                With the headlights pointed at the dawn
                We were sure we'd never see an end to it all

                And I don't even care
                To shake these zipper blues
                And we don't know just where our bones will rest
                To dust, I guess
                Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

                Double-cross the vacant and the bored
                They're not sure just what we have in store
                Morphine city slippin' dues down to sea

                That we don't even care, as restless as we are
                We feel the pull
                In the land of a thousand guilts and poured cement

                Lamented and assured to the lights and towns below
                Faster than the speed of sound
                Faster than we thought we'd go
                Beneath the sound of hope

                Justine never knew the rules
                Hung down with the freaks and ghouls
                No apologies ever need be made
                I know you better than you fake it, to see

                That we don't even care
                To shake these zipper blues
                And we don't know just where our bones will rest
                To dust, I guess
                Forgotten and absorbed into the earth below

                The street heats the urgency of now
                As you see, there's no one around
