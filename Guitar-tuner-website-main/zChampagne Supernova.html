                How many special people change?
                How many lives are livin' strange?
                Where were you while we were gettin' high?
                Slowly walkin' down the hall
                Faster than a cannonball
                Where were you while we were gettin' high?

                Someday you will find me
                Caught beneath the landslide
                In a champagne supernova in the sky
                Someday you will find me
                Caught beneath the landslide
                In a champagne supernova
                A champagne supernova in the sky

                Wake up the dawn and ask her why
                A dreamer dreams she never dies
                Wipe that tear away now from your eye
                Slowly walkin' down the hall
                Faster than a cannonball
                Where were you while we were gettin' high?

                In a champagne supernova
                A champagne supernova

                'Cause people believe
                That they're gonna get away for the summer
                But you and I, we live and die
                The world's still spinnin' 'round, we don't know why
                Why, why, why, why
